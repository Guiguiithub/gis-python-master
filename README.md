# Anzere GIS Overhall
> This was a school project, part of the HES-SO Valais/Wallis Business-IT formation and more precisely, the GIS module. The goal was to learn how to model and display online a GIS interface. Our example was the Anzere ski resort.
> 
> You can find the final version of the project only on this Github. It is not deployed online.
